## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned to make gradient background and custom animation with Tailwind CSS. I also had to put sections into shapes like triangles or pentagon which is pretty fun! Besides that I also practiced with useLocalStorage and popup sections again.

### Continued development

Even though I completed the challenge, I still want to improve it more, such as making sound plays when each game completed.

### Useful resources

- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/ofthedead/pen/rVLgNy) - This helped me for making the waves animation. The source code was just wow, I copied the keyframes and animations but still far away from the original!
